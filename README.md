# Hi! I'm Hannah 
## *Ph.D. Student, Data Visualization Nerd, Learning Python 🐍 and R 🌀*

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Kentucky, specializing in Comparative Politics. My research focuses on gender in politics, political economy, labor unions, and political elite behavior.

Originally from Tallahassee, Florida, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Political Science and International Affairs from Florida State University in 2019. I gained practical experience as a Legislative Assistant during Florida's 2020 Legislative Session and later as a Staff Assistant at the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings before pursuing my Ph.D.

Outside of academia, I enjoy spending time in nature—particularly hiking, biking, and swimming—engaging in arts and crafts like knitting, sewing, and printmaking, and playing oldtime/bluegrass music on the mandolin and guitar, as well as singing.
